1. Sales Analysis Pipeline
Goal: Analyze sales data to gain insights into revenue, sales trends, and customer behavior.

Steps:

Join DataFrames:

Join orders, customers, and products DataFrames on relevant keys (e.g., Product ID in orders with ID in products, and User ID in orders with ID in customers).
Calculate Total Revenue:

Calculate the total revenue generated by summing the Total column in the orders DataFrame.
Calculate Sales by Category:

Group the joined DataFrame by Category and calculate the total sales per category.
Customer Segmentation:

Segment customers based on their purchase behavior, such as total spending, frequency of purchases, or the variety of products purchased.
Time Series Analysis:

Perform time series analysis on Created At to understand sales trends over time (e.g., monthly or yearly trends).
Output:

Save the results to a new table or file (e.g., Parquet or CSV) for further analysis or reporting.
2. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Pipeline
Goal: Calculate the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) to understand how valuable each customer is to the business.

Steps:

Join DataFrames:

Join the orders and customers DataFrames on the User ID.
Calculate CLV:

Calculate the lifetime value for each customer by summing the Total column for each User ID.
Calculate Average Order Value:

Calculate the average order value (AOV) by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders per customer.
Calculate Purchase Frequency:

Calculate the frequency of purchases by dividing the total number of orders by the time period over which the data is collected.
Calculate CLV:

Multiply the average order value by the purchase frequency to estimate the CLV for each customer.
Output:

Save the CLV per customer to a new table for further analysis or marketing strategies.
3. Product Performance Pipeline
Goal: Evaluate the performance of different products in terms of sales, ratings, and customer preferences.

Steps:

Join DataFrames:

Join the orders and products DataFrames on Product ID.
Calculate Sales per Product:

Group the DataFrame by Product ID and Title and calculate total sales, total quantity sold, and average rating.
Top Performing Products:

Identify the top-performing products by filtering for the highest sales or highest ratings.
Customer Preferences:

Analyze customer preferences by examining the correlation between product categories and sales.
Output:

Save the product performance metrics to a new table or file for reporting.
4. Churn Prediction Pipeline
Goal: Predict customer churn based on historical purchase data and customer behavior.

Steps:

Feature Engineering:

Extract relevant features from orders and customers such as Total Spend, Frequency of Purchases, Recency of Last Purchase, etc.
Labeling:

Define a churn label (e.g., customers who havenâ€™t made a purchase in the last 6 months are labeled as churned).
Model Training:

Use the features to train a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) to predict churn.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Output:

Save the predictions to a new table or file for customer retention strategies.
5. Discount Effectiveness Pipeline
Goal: Analyze the effectiveness of discounts on sales and customer behavior.

Steps:

Filter Discounted Orders:

Filter the orders DataFrame to include only rows where Discount is not null.
Analyze Sales Impact:

Compare the sales of discounted products to non-discounted products to see if there is a significant increase in sales.
Customer Behavior:

Analyze if discounts lead to repeat purchases or if customers only purchase during discounts.
Output:

Save the insights to a new table or file to inform future discount strategies.
Implementation Notes:
Use Spark SQL or PySpark DataFrame API for performing joins, aggregations, and other transformations.
Kafka Integration: If you want to integrate Kafka, you can stream new orders, customer information, or product updates from Kafka topics and continuously update the pipeline with real-time data.
Consider using Airflow to orchestrate these pipelines if you want to schedule and manage them effectively.
These are just a few ideas, and the pipeline you choose will depend on your specific business needs and goals.
